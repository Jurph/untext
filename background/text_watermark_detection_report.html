<h1>Detecting Text-Based Watermarks in Images</h1>

<p>Overlay text watermarks present unique challenges compared to ordinary scene text. These watermarks are often semi-transparent and placed over diverse image content, making them <b>low-contrast</b> and easily confused with background elements. A robust solution needs to accurately isolate the watermark text at the pixel level. Below, we survey candidate models and recommend the best option for this task, considering accuracy, support, and efficiency.</p>

<h2>Challenges of Overlay Text vs. Scene Text</h2>

<p>Watermarks differ from natural scene text in that they are <i>deliberately blended</i> into images. Key challenges include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Transparency and Low Contrast</b>: Watermarks use semi-transparent text, causing low contrast with backgrounds. Models must detect faint text edges without many false positives.</li>
    <li><b>Varied Placement and Orientation</b>: Like scene text, watermarks can appear anywhere, at various scales and orientations (e.g. diagonally across an image).</li>
    <li><b>Confusing Background Content</b>: An algorithm must distinguish watermarks from actual scene text or background patterns.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of these factors, <b>segmentation-based text detectors</b> are favored. They label text at the pixel level, capturing fine-grained shapes of letters (even if faint), rather than just coarse bounding boxes. The model should output a segmentation mask for the watermark text.</p>

<h2>Candidate Models for Text Overlay Detection</h2>

<p>Below we examine prominent text detection models and their suitability for watermark text:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>CRAFT (Character Region Awareness For Text Detection):</b> CRAFT is a popular deep learning model that predicts character-level heatmaps and affinity between characters.</li>
    <li><b>PSENet (Progressive Scale Expansion Network):</b> An earlier segmentation-based detector (CVPR 2019) that generates <i>multi-scale text kernels</i> which expand to cover entire text instances.</li>
    <li><b>PAN / PAN++ (Pixel Aggregation Network):</b> An efficient segmentation-based detector (ICCV 2019) known for speed.</li>
    <li><b>DBNet (Differentiable Binarization Network):</b> The best candidate for detecting text-based watermarks. Introduces a differentiable binarization (DB) module to produce text masks.</li>
    <li><b>DBNet++ (Adaptive Scale Fusion):</b> An improved version introduced in 2022 that adds a feature fusion module for multi-scale text detection.</li>
    <li><b>Other Notable Mentions:</b> FAST, FCENet, ContourNet, TextSnake, TextBPN, and others.</li>
    <li><b>YOLOv8 (and Detection Transformers):</b> Some recent works try framing watermark text detection as a generic object detection problem.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recommendation: DBNet++ (Differentiable Binarization Network)</h2>

<p>Taking all factors into account, <b>DBNet++</b> emerges as the best choice for text-based watermark detection. It offers an ideal combination of accuracy, granularity, and practicality.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Pixel-Level Mask Output:</b> DBNet++ was designed to produce segmentation maps of text regions, which are then binarized into precise text masks.</li>
    <li><b>High Accuracy on Challenging Text:</b> DBNet++ achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and speed on multiple benchmarks.</li>
    <li><b>Speed and Efficiency:</b> Despite its high accuracy, DBNet++ remains lightweight enough for local deployment.</li>
    <li><b>Resource Requirements:</b> A 12GB VRAM GPU is more than sufficient.</li>
    <li><b>Active Open-Source Support:</b> The model has robust support in open-source OCR ecosystems like MMOCR, PaddleOCR, DocTR, and more.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Setup and Usage Details</h3>

<p>To concretize the recommendation, here’s what using DBNet/DBNet++ might look like:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Installation:</b> Install necessary packages like MMOCR or DocTR to get started.</li>
    <li><b>Model Selection:</b> Load the DBNet++ model weights from repositories like MMOCR or DocTR.</li>
    <li><b>Running Inference:</b> Provide the image to the model’s inference function. The output will be the detected regions.</li>
    <li><b>Post-processing:</b> Optional steps to filter the watermark detection, based on size or content.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p><b>DBNet++</b> emerges as the best choice for text-based watermark detection, combining the strengths of segmentation precision and efficient inference. It is academically validated and widely available in open-source. By integrating DBNet++ into a Python-based pipeline, one can achieve watermark text detection with pixel-level masks, under 1 second per image on a 12GB GPU.</p>
